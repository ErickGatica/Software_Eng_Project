# Introduction

This software is designed for the generation of absorption spectroscopy data, lookup table creation, and fitting of experimental data. Absorption spectroscopy is a powerful technique used to analyze the concentration of specific gases or molecules in a sample by measuring the absorption of light at different wavelengths. By passing light through a sample and detecting how much of that light is absorbed at particular wavelengths, researchers can identify and quantify the presence of various substances. This technique is widely used in fields ranging from environmental monitoring to chemical analysis and industrial applications.

Developed at the Precision Laser Diagnostics Laboratory (PLDL) at the University of Colorado Boulder, this software aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of spectroscopic measurements. The PLDL specializes in cutting-edge research and development of laser-based diagnostics for energy and environmental applications, including combustion diagnostics, emissions detection, and gas sensing technologies.

Our software is designed to be a flexible and user-friendly tool for the spectroscopy community, allowing users to generate synthetic absorption spectra, create lookup tables for various gases and conditions, and fit experimental data for accurate gas detection and quantification. By integrating advanced algorithms for data processing and signal fitting, this tool can significantly reduce the time and effort required for absorption spectroscopy experiments, making it a valuable resource for both researchers and industry professionals in the field.
